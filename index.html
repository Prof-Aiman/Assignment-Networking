    <p class="p-2">The aircraft manufacturing industry is a crucial sector within the aerospace industry, responsible for designing, developing, and producing commercial and military aircraft. It involves highly advanced technology, innovation, and a skilled workforce. Major manufacturers such as Airbus and Boeing dominate the commercial sector, meeting the increasing demand for air travel with more fuel-efficient and passenger-friendly aircraft. Military aircraft manufacturers like Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems focus on producing advanced platforms for defense forces. Safety regulations, global competition, and economic factors present challenges, but the industry continues to thrive due to the growing demand for air travel and ongoing technological advancements.</p>
